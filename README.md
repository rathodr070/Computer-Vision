I couldn't complete the task properly during the test and the laptop issue. But I'll try to send the proper code ASAP. But even if it is not considered fine, I just want to give my best.

The above code tries to detect the object using openCV. The number of cars might be solved using YOLO algo but I'll try to submit it if I can. 
Thank you.
